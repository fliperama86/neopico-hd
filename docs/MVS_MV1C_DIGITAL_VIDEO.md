# Neo Geo MVS MV1C Digital Video Specification

Technical specification for the digital video signals on the Neo Geo MVS MV1C arcade board and the RP2350-specific capture implementation.

## 1. Signal Overview

The MVS MV1C generates 15-bit RGB video digitally, clocked at 6 MHz with composite sync (CSYNC).

### Video Signals

| Signal | Width  | Description                | Tap Point (MV1C) | GPIO (Pico) |
| ------ | ------ | -------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| CSYNC  | 1 bit  | Composite sync, active low | R51              | GPIO 27     |
| PCLK   | 1 bit  | Pixel clock, 6 MHz         | PC23 pin 11      | GPIO 28     |
| B[4:0] | 5 bits | Blue MSB -> LSB            | R2R Input        | GPIO 29-33  |
| G[4:0] | 5 bits | Green MSB -> LSB           | R2R Input        | GPIO 34-38  |
| R[4:0] | 5 bits | Red MSB -> LSB             | R2R Input        | GPIO 39-43  |
| SHADOW | 1 bit  | Intensity control          | Pre-DAC          | GPIO 44     |
| DARK   | 1 bit  | Intensity control          | Pre-DAC          | GPIO 45     |

**Capture Logic**: PIO1 samples GPIO 27-45 (19 pins) as a contiguous block. IN_BASE = GP27; CSYNC is at bit 0, PCLK at bit 1, then B/G/R, SHADOW at bit 17, and DARK at bit 18. Sync and pixel SMs use the same window; sync waits on CSYNC (GP27), pixel SM samples on PCLK (GP28).

## 2. Capture Strategy

### PIO Hardware Synchronization

-   **Line Sync**: PIO1 self-synchronizes to the CSYNC falling edge for every single line to prevent horizontal drift.
-   **Start-of-Frame**: Core 0 detects VSYNC pulses, resets the PIO state, and triggers the capture IRQ precisely at the first active video line.

### Zero-Overhead DMA

-   **Ping-Pong Buffering**: DMA moves raw pixel words to RAM in the background. While DMA captures Line N into `buffer[0]`, the CPU processes Line N-1 from `buffer[1]`.
-   **Zero Jitter**: This offloads the high-speed work from the CPU, allowing Core 0 to handle conversion and OSD tasks without missing pixels.

### Hardware-Accelerated Pixel Conversion

The Neo Geo uses two special signals, **DARK** and **SHADOW**, to modify pixel brightness. To handle this with minimum CPU overhead, NeoPico-HD uses a runtime-generated LUT in Core 0 capture.

1.  **Default Build** (`NEOPICO_ENABLE_DARK_SHADOW=OFF`):
    -   A 32K-entry LUT (64KB) converts corrected RGB555 -> RGB565.
    -   SHADOW/DARK bits are captured but ignored in pixel conversion.
2.  **Optional Build** (`NEOPICO_ENABLE_DARK_SHADOW=ON`):
    -   A 64K-entry LUT (128KB) is indexed by RGB555+SHADOW.
    -   SHADOW path applies legacy main-branch dimming math (halve channels, then fixed dark offset).
    -   DARK is still captured for diagnostics, but is not part of LUT indexing in this path.
3.  **Capture Width**:
    -   Capture uses 19 bits (RGB555 + SHADOW + DARK).

## 3. RP2350 Hardware Platform Notes (Bank 1)

Capturing from GPIO 27-45 requires using the RP2350's **Bank 1** features and managing specific hardware/SDK quirks.

### GPIOBASE Register

-   **PIO0/1 only**: PIO0 and PIO1 have a `GPIOBASE` register (offset `0x168`) that defines a 32-pin window.
-   **Current Config**: `GPIOBASE` is set to **16**, giving the PIO access to **GPIO 16 through 47**.
-   **PIO2 Limitation**: PIO2 lacks this register and is fixed to Bank 0 (GPIO 0-31).

### PIO Instruction Addressing

-   **Relative Addressing**: In Bank 1 mode, instructions like `WAIT GPIO <n>` are relative to `GPIOBASE`.
-   **Recommendation**: Use **`WAIT PIN <n>`** instead of `WAIT GPIO`. `WAIT PIN` is relative to the SM's `IN_BASE` and avoids the SDK's automatic (and often incorrect) XOR bit-flipping during program loading.

### RP2350-E9 Erratum (Sticky Pins)

-   **The Bug**: Internal pull-downs can latch GPIOs at ~2.1V, preventing a logic "Low".
-   **Mitigation**: `gpio_disable_pulls()` is called on all capture pins. Avoid `pio_gpio_init()` as it can re-enable default pulls.

## 4. Implementation Constraints

-   **Clock**: The system runs at **126 MHz** to provide a perfect 25.2 MHz pixel clock (div 5) for HDMI.
-   **Grounding**: A solid shared ground between MVS and Pico is mandatory to prevent digital noise.
