# Neo Geo MVS MV1C Digital Audio Specification

Technical specification for the digital audio signals on the Neo Geo MVS MV1C arcade board.

## Signal Format

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Format | **Right-justified** (NOT standard I2S) |
| Data width | 16-bit signed PCM (2's complement) |
| Sample rate | ~55,555 Hz (8 MHz / 144) |
| Frame size | 24 BCK cycles per channel |

### WS Polarity (Critical!)
The MV1C uses opposite polarity from standard I2S:
- **WS HIGH** = LEFT channel
- **WS LOW** = RIGHT channel

## Capture Strategy (NeoPico-HD)

### 1. PIO State Machine
A dedicated PIO state machine (on PIO2) captures the serial stream.
- **Clock Edge**: Samples DAT on the **BCK Rising Edge**.
- **Frame Sync**: Waits for a falling edge on WS to align with the Right channel start.
- **Word Extraction**: Captures 24 bits and pushes them to the FIFO.

### 2. DMA Ring Buffer
A hardware DMA channel drains the PIO FIFO into a 16KB circular buffer in RAM. This provides enough headroom (~2 frames) to allow for "bursty" CPU processing without losing audio data.

### 3. Pipeline Processing
The Core 0 main loop polls the capture ring and runs the following stages:
- **DC Filter**: Removes DC offset from the MV1C digital source.
- **Lowpass Filter**: Anti-aliasing to ensure a clean sound.
- **SRC (Sample Rate Conversion)**: High-quality decimation from 55.5kHz to 48kHz for HDMI standard compatibility.

## Tap Points (MV1C Board)

| Signal | Location |
|--------|----------|
| I2S WS | R90 (or GPIO 1) |
| I2S DAT| R91 (or GPIO 0) |
| I2S BCK| R92 (or GPIO 2) |

**Mandatory**: Use a solid shared ground between the MVS and the Pico board. Digital audio is extremely sensitive to ground potential differences.
